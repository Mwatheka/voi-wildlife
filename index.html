          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            <b>Tsavo East National Park</b> is located in southeastern Kenya and a little northwest of the sister <b>Tsavo West National Park</b>. The Tsavo East Park encompasses an area of 5,308 square miles (13,747 sq km). The <b>Tsavo River</b> flows easterly through the Tsavo park and serves as the Tsavo East Park namesake along with Tsavo West National Park, Tsavo East borders <b>Chyulu Hills National Park</b>. The <b>Tsavo East Park</b>b> is comprised of grasslands and savanna and riverbeds created by the Tsavo and Athi rivers which combine into the Galana River.  Collectively, they create one of the richest biodiverse areas of Africa with an abundance of <b>wildlife </b>. Tsavo East National Park offers great <b>wildlife</b> viewing in pristine <b>wilderness</b>b>. All of the Big Five Wildlife are here. Elephants are very common and their red dust coating makes them stand out against the arid environment. Of the big cats, lions are most easily spotted. Buffalo, zebra and plenty of Masai giraffes are some of the other animals you can expect to see. Tsavo East has a good range of unusual wildlife the antelope. This is one of the few places to see the fringe-eared oryx. The lesser kudu is very shy, but can sometimes be seen darting off into the bushes. The long-necked gerenuk can be found standing on its hind legs to reach the sparse foliage of trees and bushes. With some luck, you might spot the critically endangered Hunter's hartebeest (hirola). Tsavo East can be visited throughout the year, but the best time for <b>wildlife</b> viewing is from June to October – in the Dry season. During this period, the vegetation is thinner and Wildlife gather around predictable sources of water. The dry spell from January to February, between the short and long rains, is also a great time for wildlife viewing. The Big 5 (lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, and buffalo) are all accounted for. There are approximately 1675 lions across the surrounding ecosystem.  Predators’ wildlife’ species include lion, caracal, African wildcat, cheetah, bat-eared fox, hyena, jackal, leopard, mongoose, and of course the lion. Other wildlife species include aardwolf, baboon, buffalo, bushbuck, dik-dik, duiker, eland, elephant, gazelle, genet, giraffe, hartebeest, hyrax, impala, klipspringer, kudu, oryx, porcupine, warthog, waterbuck, zebra and many smaller species. Birdwatchers also have plenty to be excited for with over 500 species of birds found within Tsavo national park.  Ostrich is the largest however they are accompanied by kingfisher, hornbills, herons, starlings, weavers, buzzards, kestrels, among others. Wildlife is not the only draw into Tsavo East Park. Visitors can also look forward to seeing Lugard Falls which a collection of rapids is cascading over some rough terrain.  Additionally, there is the Yatta Plateau which delivers the longest lava flow in the world. Mudanda Rock is a scenic lookout which provides great views of elephant and other animals that come to drink water during the dry season. The lookout from Mudanda Rock is certainly a highlight for <b>wildlife</b> viewing.  However, without question, the abundant and diverse wildlife is the highlight of the national park.  Tsavo East provides opportunities to see the Big Five which include the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and the rhino. This one of the true wildlife havens and provides visitors with a rich biodiversity experience.  Wildlife is abundant and ready to enrich your Kenya experience. Tsavo East is a wilderness area rich in diverse and <b>abundant wildlife</b>.  There are no trails for hiking in the national park.

The primary purpose of the walking safaris is to introduce and educate visitors about the flora and fauna of Tsavo. However, your walking safari is also an opportunity to keep your eyes open for wildlife while breathing the pristine fresh air and gazing across the astounding landscapes. Your guided walking safari may take you on foot across Yatta Plateau which is the world's longest lava flow as well as along jagged volcanic cones.

          <h2>When Should You Travel Tsavo East   </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Your time in Tsavo East National Park promises to be an unforgettable wilderness safari in Kenya. Relish in Kenya finest wildlife viewing and wildlife safari experiences while enjoying the warm temperatures. Daytime temperatures in the Tsavo park range from 80 F (27 C) to 90 F (32 C) depending on your month of travel. The months with the coolest daytime temperatures are June through August, and January to March have the warmest daytime temperatures.  While these climatic conditions make Tsavo East Park a superb Kenya wildlife safari destination any time of year, you should also consider the effects of the dry and rainy seasons. The presence or absence of rain affects not only the vegetation, but also wildlife behavior, room rates and logistics.  We primarily recommend the long dry season from April to October to most of Voi Wildlife Lodge visitants to Tsavo, especially if you are new to wildlife safari to Kenya. Without adequate precipitation, plants and grasses are sparse at best, and seasonal watering holes are dry. In the search for food and water, wildlife relocates to more permanent water sources where they also find adequate water and surrounding nourishment. As a result, the wildlife is found gathered in small areas. The minimal vegetation and diverse groups of wildlife affords you to view numerous species in a central area, especially herbivores, much more easily than when dispersed wildlife have more options for eating and drinking. These prime conditions draw many guests, both locally and internationally. The only exceptions are Christmas and New Year’s. Other prices, though, are constant regardless of the season, such as meals, park entry fees, logistics, and activities, to name only some of the costs that are associated with your exploratory <b>wildlife safari in Tsavo</b>. Rainfall during the short-wet season in Tsavo compared to other parts of Kenya is not similar. There is more precipitation in comparison. This is primarily due to location of the park being so close to the coast of Kenya. n January and February, a short hot, dry season arrives, followed by the wettest time of year – the long rains from March through May and parts of June. The precipitation is significant, and rain may fall continuously for several days but not throughout the day. Roads and trails are muddy because of the increased moisture. Your safari activities may be impacted due to the difficulty of navigating the park by vehicle and on foot.
